;;;; HOT-PATCH OVERLAY for CRISP.COMPILER
;;;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;;; Empty by design.  Endeavour 152's contents were migrated into src/ on 2026-08-19;
;;;; endeavour 154's on 2026-08-22.
;;;;
;;;; 154 migrated SIX definitions into src/mma.lisp, all of them plain defuns (no defvars, no
;;;; macros, no structs), so unlike 152 this fold needed no insert-after-in-package care:
;;;;
;;;;   %emit-wgmma-mma-only        NEW    — beside %emit-nvvm-wgmma
;;;;   %emit-nvvm-wgmma            REPLACED — one fence / N mma_async / one commit / one wait
;;;;   %wgmma-store-rewrite-origin NEW    — absolute (ROW COL) origin + row-major emission
;;;;   %wgmma-store-rewrite        REPLACED — now a thin caller of -origin (behaviour unchanged)
;;;;   analyze-store-tile-at-mma   NEW    — placed BEFORE register-mma-analyzers, which #'-refs it
;;;;   register-mma-analyzers      REPLACED — STORE-TILE-AT added to the dispatch table
;;;;
;;;; Verified behaviour-preserving by md5 of the emitted PTX for four kernels plus spec 03,
;;;; before and after the fold — see tests/spec/154-nvidia-perf/nvidia-perf.md, Phase 11.
;;;;
;;;; The two spec validators that came with 154 live in overlays/spec-runner-overlay.lisp and
;;;; were NOT folded: run-specs.lisp calls (main) on its last line, so anything appended after
;;;; it is defined too late to be found.  They belong in that overlay or ahead of the (main)
;;;; call, not at end of file.
;;;;
;;;; INSTRUCTIONS (unchanged):
;;;; 1. Append new/fixed function definitions to the end of this file.
;;;; 2. Add a comment referencing the original file (e.g. ;; src/codegen.lisp)
;;;; 3. Do not modify the original file in src/ until cleanup time.

;;; ===================================================================
;;; ENDEAVOUR 155 — thread the ELEMENT TYPE through register tiles.
;;;
;;; THE DEFECT.  `analyze-make-register-tile` read the element type and then threw it away:
;;;
;;;     (elem (first args))
;;;     ...
;;;     (declare (ignore elem))          ; tf32/fp32 fixed for now
;;;
;;; so `(make-register-tile-ring bfloat16 (32 16) ...)` parsed and produced FLOAT32 fragments.
;;; Confirmed in the emitted SPIR-V for benchmarks/matmul/sec2_top_bf16/matmul_bmg_bf16.spv:
;;; the module contains exactly ONE float type -- `TypeFloat 259 32` -- and all three
;;; `TypeCooperativeMatrixKHR` name it as their component type.  There is no 16-bit type of any
;;; kind.  `bfloat16` survived only in parameter NAMES, inherited from the def-type.
;;;
;;; So the tensors were bf16 in memory while the matrices consuming them were fp32.  That is a
;;; CORRECTNESS bug, and it explains the seven empty `sec2_top_bf16_Crisp_*.json` result files
;;; far better than the register-pressure warning that was the first suspect.
;;;
;;; NOT DONE HERE, DELIBERATELY: the GRF byte width.  `%spv-kernel-register-demand` multiplies
;;; the element count by a hardcoded 4, and an earlier plan proposed patching that to 2 for bf16.
;;; That would have been wrong while the compiler still EMITTED float32 -- a register model
;;; precisely wrong about real code is worse than one obviously broken, because it stops warning
;;; about a kernel that genuinely will spill.  With the element type threaded, the width becomes
;;; a property of the type; that follows as step 2 and is handled below.
;;;
;;; NOTE FOR THE SRC PATCH: %elem-coop-type and %elem-bytes are new (src/mma.lisp);

   WHY.  A mixed-precision MMA has two element types, not one: XMX/DPAS and the NVIDIA tensor

   element type can only ever express the uniform case, so once the operand loads started

          @__spirv_CooperativeMatrixMulAddKHR(target(...float, 3, 8, 8, 0), ...)

   Deriving from the values makes the declaration correct BY CONSTRUCTION: whatever A, B and C
   actually are is what gets declared, so the signature cannot drift from the operands again --
   including for the fp32 case, where this is exactly what it built before.

   THE ASSERTION A COMPILE CHECK CANNOT MAKE.  Before 155 the element type was discarded at
   make-register-tile, so a bf16 kernel compiled cleanly, emitted a valid .spv and ran — with
   every cooperative matrix silently float32.  The only symptom was benchmark result files
   containing `results: []`, which went unchased through six re-runs.  Exit codes cannot see
   this; only the emitted types can.

   Asserts, on the disassembled module:
     1. a 16-bit float type exists              — bf16 reached codegen at all
     2. a cooperative matrix names it           — it reached the MMA operands, not just the module
     3. a 32-bit float type ALSO exists         — the accumulator is still fp32
     4. SPV_KHR_bfloat16 is declared            — the module is self-consistent

   (3) is not padding.  Mixed-precision MMA is bf16 operands with an fp32 accumulator, so an
   all-bf16 module would be as wrong as the all-f32 one it replaced.  This fails both directions.
