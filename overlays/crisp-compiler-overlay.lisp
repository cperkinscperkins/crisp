;;;;
;;;; Late-binding overrides for CRISP.COMPILER.
;;;;
;;;; EMPTY BY DESIGN.  Definitions live here only while a feature or bug fix is in
;;;; flight; once it settles they are folded back into their home file in src/ so
;;;; that the source of truth is one place.  Folded 2026-08-02 (endeavour 145),
;;;; and again 2026-08-09 (endeavour 146).
;;;;
;;;; To add one: APPEND a complete definition with a `;; src/<file>.lisp` comment
;;;; above it saying where it belongs.  Do not patch definitions already here.
;;;; Note that macros and structs CANNOT be overridden this way -- they are not
;;;; late-bound -- and must be patched in src/ directly.
;;;;
;;;; A NOTE ON WRAPPERS, learned the hard way in 146.  Capturing an original with
;;;;     (defvar *orig-foo* (symbol-function 'foo))
;;;; and then redefining FOO works beautifully in an overlay and does NOT survive
;;;; copy-paste into src/ -- there is no "original" there to capture.  Each such
;;;; wrapper has to be MERGED INTO the real function body when it is folded back.
;;;; If you reach for that pattern, note in the header which src function the
;;;; wrapper's body ultimately belongs inside.
