The Blueprint Philosophy üìê
===========================

Crisp isn't just a kernel language; it's a complete development solution that respects your existing infrastructure. We understand that you've already invested heavily in your host-side application, build systems, and memory management. Crisp is designed to integrate into your world, not force you to adopt ours.

- A Blueprint, Not a Building: Instead of providing a rigid, all-encompassing runtime that dictates your project's structure, the Crisp compiler generates a simple, correct, and human-readable blueprint‚Äîthe exact C++ or Python code needed to launch your kernel.

- Correct by Construction: This isn't just example code. It's a guaranteed-correct implementation of the host-device interface for your specific kernel. It eliminates the tedious and error-prone task of manually setting kernel arguments, ensuring the right types are used in the right order.

- Empowers, Doesn't Dictate: You are free to take this blueprint and integrate it into your application however you see fit. Wrap it in your own classes, adapt it to your memory management strategy, or plug it into your existing task scheduler. Crisp solves the difficult kernel-specific part of the problem and hands you a clean, working solution to build upon.
